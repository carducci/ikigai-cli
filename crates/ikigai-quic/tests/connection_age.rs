//! A door bounds connection age, so an enrolment edit revokes within a known time
//! (ledger #1179).
//!
//! The [`Minter`] runs once per CONNECTION. A host that re-reads its enrolment per connection
//! therefore revokes a client only when that client next connects, and a client holding one
//! connection open (a daemon's standing mount) may never do so. `serve_bounded` closes a
//! connection once it is `max_age` old; the resolver heals onto a fresh one at its next call,
//! and the minter decides afresh. These tests pin the three halves: the unbounded door keeps
//! one connection (the gap, reproduced), the bounded door re-mints, and a revoked client's
//! next call after the bound is refused. A fourth pins that a call in flight when the bound
//! passes still gets its reply, run once.
